These emails should contain all the photographs except for the three composite images (Figures 12, 13, and 18), but those files are so big that I didn't re-send them.  If necessary, I can re-label them with their figure numbers and send them again.  Their figure numbers should be as follows:

Figure 12:  the prehistoric projectile points (8 photos)
Figure 13:  non-diagnostic prehistoric artifacts (6 photos)
Figure 18:  historic artifacts (4 photos)
