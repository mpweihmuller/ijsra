# Abstract
 
Poggio Civitate is the location of an ancient Etruscan 
settlement in present-day Tuscany which, in the Archaic period
(c.580-c.480 BC), was home to a monumental courtyard complex, its roof
adorned with a series of terracotta acroteria. These acroteria took the
form of seated and standing men and women, which form the basis of this
study, as well as fantastic and real animals. The question addressed
will be the appropriate identification of these figures, regarding which
there is currently no scholarly agreement. The matter is contentious
because of the uncertainty about the function of the Archaic Building
itself. This paper argues that the Archaic Building most likely
functioned as a domestic complex, based on an analysis of the plan of
the building and its relationship to the previous phase. It is then
argued that the arbitrary categories of "mortal" and "divine" often
applied to the acroteria are an anachronism and that the acroteria
should in fact be identified more broadly as status markers: symbols of
the wealth and power of the Archaic Building's elite occupants.

# Introduction

Poggio Civitate is located in northern inland Etruria, near to the River
Ombrone and the modern *comune* of Murlo, an hour's drive south of the
major city of Siena (see **Fig.1**). It is situated in a prominent,
highly visible position (Meyers 2003: 114) on the eastern portion of a
hilltop plateau bordering central Tuscany (Donati 2000: 324; Meyers
2003: 72). Occupied since the Iron Age, the site was first
monumentalized in the Orientalizing period (c.720-c.580 BC) (Haynes
2000: 115). After the Orientalizing Period complex was destroyed in the
late seventh century BC (Turfa & Steinmayer 2002: 3), Poggio Civitate
was rebuilt in the Archaic Period (Damgaard Andersen 1990: 79). It was
upon the Archaic Building that the rooftop acroteria considered in this
paper once stood.

A descriptive overview of the rooftop acroteria from the site will be
given in Part One. To interpret these acroteria, one must first decide
upon the likely function of the Archaic Building, something that is
still disputed. Therefore, Part Two of this paper is dedicated to
demonstrating precisely how the varied scholarly interpretations of the
site's function impact the understanding of the acroteria. From this
discussion, the conclusion is drawn that the Archaic Building functioned
as a domestic structure. Finally, in Part Three, the implications that
this proposed function has on the interpretation of the acroteria are
explored. All dates given will be BC.[^1]

**Part One: Descriptive Overview**

The Orientalizing phase of occupation at Poggio Civitate (**Fig.2**) is
dated from 650 to around 610/600BC, when a fire destroyed the site
(Edlund-Gantz 1972: 198). The Orientalizing complex comprised three
buildings; OC1, a residence; OC2, an industrial workshop; and OC3, a
tripartite structure which has been interpreted as a religious building
(Haynes 2000: 115).

The Archaic Building (**Fig.3**) was constructed between 600-575BC atop
the remains of the Orientalizing complex (Haynes 2000: 117). It
consisted of a monumental four-winged structure measuring 60 x 61.8m
(Meyers 2012: 4), enclosing a colonnaded courtyard (O'Donoghue 2013:
269), surrounded by four wings of continuous rooms (Meyers 2003: 70). On
the western side, a defensive structure extended the complex a further
30m (Tuck et al. 2010: 93).

**Conclusion**

Overall, this paper has argued that the function of the Archaic Building
at Poggio Civitate was domestic, based on the internal layout of the
building and its relationship to the preceding Orientalizing phase. As a
consequence, this paper advocates the interpretation of the acroteria as
status markers, symbols of the wealth and power wielded by the
aristocrats who inhabited the Archaic Building. This approach is
prioritized over that seen in existing scholarship, which favours the
arbitrary categories of "mortal" or "divine".
