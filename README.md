International Journal of Student Research in Archaeology
====

In this repository we edit articles published in the __[_International Journal of Student Research in Archaeology_](http://www.ijsra.org) (IJSRA)__. The peer-reviewed journal's webpage is http://www.ijsra.org, and the open-access issues may be freely downloaded from there.

For this we use the document class [_ijsra_](https://github.com/LukasCBossert/documentclass-ijsra)
and the citation style [_biblatex-ijsra_](https://github.com/LukasCBossert/biblatex-ijsra) developed for the journal.
Both are part of TeXlive/MikTeX distributions.

We are always looking for people who would like to submit articles, contribute to peer-review, or help edit articles for publication. If you are interested, you may contact us at editor.ijsra@gmail.com.
