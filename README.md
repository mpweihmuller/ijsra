International Journal of Student Research in Archaeology
====

In this repository we edit the articles, reviews of books, conferences etc. which are being published in the __[International Journal of Student Research in Archaeology](http://www.ijsra.org) (IJSRA)__. 

---
For that we use the document class [_ijsra_](https://github.com/LukasCBossert/documentclass-ijsra)
and the citation style called [_biblatex-ijsra_](https://github.com/LukasCBossert/biblatex-ijsra).
Both are part of TeXlive/MikTeX distributions.

---
We always look for people who like to submit articles or who like to edit articles for publication.

If you like to turn in your paper as LaTeX-Code you can use the template hosted at [OverLeaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-international-journal-of-student-research-in-archaeology-ijsra/nwdmgkqqxkhd#.WF2fkLGYwiM).
