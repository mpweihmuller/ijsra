% \def\abstract{In early 2017, an archaeological survey was conducted across a large section of the Schaub family farm in northeastern Peoria County, Illinois. The purpose of the survey was to locate and delineate any and all archaeological sites within the defined survey area and register them with the Illinois State Museum. One previously unknown site, newly registered as Site 11P852, was discovered within the survey area; this site includes a prehistoric component and two separate historic components. The prehistoric component consists entirely of lithic remains, chiefly lithic debitage, as well as several tools or tool fragments. Diagnostic prehistoric artifacts found across the site indicate that it was occupied by Native Americans over a period of thousands of years, possibly as early as the Early Archaic Period (8000--6000\BCE). The westernmost historic component is a scatter of surface artifacts in a tilled agricultural field, while the easternmost historic component contains three intact features, including a cellar pit and a brick vault cistern, as well as several surface and subsurface artifacts. The integrity of the site varies, as large areas have been damaged by plowing or erosion, whereas other portions have remained relatively intact.}
