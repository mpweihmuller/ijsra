\def\thanknote{Jane Fyfe is currently completing a PhD in archaeology at the University of Western Australia, and working in Aboriginal Health Training. She has many research interests, including the intersection of historical and Indigenous archaeologies, the role of rock art in all its forms (from prehistoric pigment and engravings to contemporary graffiti) in identity formation and resistance. Jane is also interested in exploring the stories and archaeologies of the unseen and unheard through historical and contemporary archaeology. She is passionate about teaching and sharing archaeology with university students, community volunteers and enthusiasts, especially its practical application and interpretation. She has published in journals her work on historical inscriptions in the Torres Strait and rock art in northern Australia, as well as her PhD research in the southern Kimberley, Western Australia and presented her research at Conferences in the USA and Australia.
	
Sean Winter is an early career researcher currently working in Western Australia. He has diverse research interests with a primary concentration on historical archaeology in Australia. He also has secondary interests in the archaeology of the Greco-Roman period in Egypt; in the archaeology of World War II; in methodological issues related to excavation and stratigraphy, particularly related to urban sites and buildings archaeology; in issues related to teaching and learning in archaeology; and in heritage issues related to convict sites. He has published in numerous journals and will shortly be releasing a book on the convict system in Western Australia.

Ashleigh Murszewski is a developing geoarchaeologist working on various deposits within Western Australia and Southern Africa. With a dual qualification in geology and archaeology, she has pursued an interdisciplinary specialty focusing on understanding geomorphological context of archaeological and palaeoanthropological sites. Current research projects include; local sedimentology of alluvial and karst sequences (inc. micromorphological and sedimentological applications) and, regional studies of palaeocave formation and survival. She has published and presented in Australian journals and conferences on her research in Western Australia, and will commence a PhD at La Trobe University, Melbourne, Victoria in 2016.}

\begin{IJSRAabstract}
Australia\marginnote{Abstract} is not unique in identifying the gap between the skillset required to work in the archaeology profession and the skills provided during a standard archaeology degree. 
The most significant and enduring gap has been identified by the students themselves; the practical application of archaeological field skills. 
In Western Australia, students have taken the initiative, and moved away from the academic world, to develop a practical model for supervised, structured fieldwork that increases practice opportunities and, consequently, their skills and confidence in this area when they graduate.
A model for skills development, designed and tested by the Archaeological Society of Western Australia, demonstrates that using a flexible approach within a well-structured model may be used effectively for a variety of projects, whilst meeting both the ethical and legal needs contiguous in archaeological practice. 
This non-academic model offers real research and field experiences to students, to enhance their skill development and complement their academic studies. 
The model’s flexibility provides the capacity for implementation both within and outside of Australia.

\end{IJSRAabstract}

\lettrine[nindent=0em,lines=3]{A}{rchaeological} fieldwork may take many forms and future archaeologists need relevant training in a range of skills, including, but not limited to, excavation, survey, building recording, artefact analysis, and the many aspects of teamwork and organisation associated with fieldwork. 
Developing a range of skills to an appropriate level of competency takes time and effort, both on the part of students and those teaching them. Over the past decade there has been an ongoing discussion within the discipline of archaeology in Australia regarding the level of practical skills gained during a standard three or four-year archaeology degree. 
The debate over whether universities provide sufficient practical training to appropriately prepare undergraduates for the realities of the profession has at times become heated \parencites[e.g.][]{cobb2012}{mytum2012a}{ulm2005}{ulm2013}. 
Profiles of the discipline in Australia suggest that commercial and consulting practitioners see a disparity between practical skills taught at universities \parencite{beck2005}{colley2012}{cosgrove2012}{fredrickson2005}{hall2005}
 and the needs of professional practice \parencite{colley2004}{colley2012}{cosgrove2013}{gibbs2005}{ireland2013}{ulm2005}{ulm2013}. 
 This issue is not restricted to Australia; it has also been the subject of research and discussion in over the last decade in Britain \parencites [e.g.][]{aitchinson2004}{cobb2012} and the USA
  \parencite[e.g.][]{boytner2012}.
